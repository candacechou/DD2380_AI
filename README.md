This is part of the assignment 1 in the course of DD2380 Artificial Intelligence @ KTH Royal Institute of Technology (19FALL)

This is the practice of HMMs:

1. Next Observation Distribution Estimation
2. Probability of the observation sequence
3. Viterbi Algorithm
4. Bauch-Welch Algorithm (Model Parameter Estimation)
